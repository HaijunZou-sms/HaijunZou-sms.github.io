About Me
=====
I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Ya-xiang Yuan](https://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Peking University in 2024, advised by [Prof. Zaiwen Wen](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~wenzw/). 

Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on numerical optimization, with an emphasis on both theoretic foundations and algorithm development. Recently, I have been working on **Learn to Optimize (L2O)**, particularly on developing data-driven algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization algorithms.
